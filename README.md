# MXEC-BossRunner-alpha-1.8
This is a simple game where you can shoot enemies. There are currently 6 bosses with music on a few of them. I made this using turbowarp. This can be played in a browser like chrome and edge.

# Controls:
keyboard: 
WASD or arrow keys to move
space to shoot

mobile:
these controls are a little iffy.
you move your ship by dragging it and as you drag it, it will shoot.
bosses only deal damage if you hit them, or, if you play with a keyboard, the bosses' bullets will also deal damage when they hit you. A full mobile version will come out soon.
